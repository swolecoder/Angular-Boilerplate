# Angular-Boilerplate

Starter Angular App 

## Development server

Run `yarn install` and then `yarn start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `yarn build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
